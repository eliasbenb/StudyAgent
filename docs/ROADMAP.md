# Roadmap

This document keeps future-looking material out of the top-level README while preserving the broader direction for the project.

## Near Term

### `data_quality_interpretation`

Interpret Data Quality Dashboard, Achilles Heel, and Achilles characterization outputs in the context of a user's study intent so the findings are more actionable for study design.

### `create_new_phenotype_definition`

Guide users through building a new phenotype definition for a target or outcome cohort, including concept selection, concept-set organization, and cohort-definition logic assembly.

## Longer Term

Build out the broader service set, then evaluate and user-test each service as part of a larger study-agent workflow.

## Broader Future-Service Catalog

These items are directional and should not be read as fully implemented.

### High-Level Conceptual Services

- `protocol_generator`: generate a templated protocol from a study intent
- `background_writer`: draft a study background with supporting rationale
- `protocol_critique`: review a protocol for completeness and consistency
- `dag_create`: propose a causal graph from protocol or study-intent text
- `explain_cohort_diagnostics`: summarize cohort diagnostics outputs in study context
- `explain_incidence_estimation_characterization_results`: summarize completed analysis outputs in study context

### High-Level Operational Services

- `strategus_*`: compose, compare, edit, critique, and debug Strategus JSON
